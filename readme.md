## üåü Features

- **Command Tracking**: Monitors commands, execution time, and patterns
- **Error Analysis**: AI-powered error analysis and solution suggestions
- **Documentation**: Auto-generates tutorials and documentation
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic issue creation and management
- **Context Awareness**: Understands command context and suggests improvements
- **AI-Powered**: Uses OpenAI and Claude for intelligent analysis

## üìã Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sdk-assistant.git
cd sdk-assistant

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîë Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
GITHUB_REPO=username/repo
```

## üöÄ Usage Example: Testing HuggingFace Model Deployment to SageMaker

Here's a practical example of using the SDK Assistant to test and document a HuggingFace model deployment to AWS SageMaker.

### Starting a Session

```bash
# Start the SDK assistant with a description of your task
python -m sdk_assistant start "Testing HuggingFace model deployment to SageMaker using magemaker CLI"
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# The assistant will track these commands and their outcomes:

# 1. Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# 2. Install magemaker CLI
pip install magemaker-cli

# 3. Initialize magemaker project
magemaker init huggingface-deployment

# 4. Configure the deployment
magemaker configure --model "huggingface/bert-base-uncased" \
                    --instance-type "ml.m5.xlarge" \
                    --region "us-west-2"

# 5. Deploy the model
magemaker --deploy
```

### What the Assistant Does

When you run these commands, the SDK Assistant will:

1. **Track Command Execution**:
```python
{
    "command": "magemaker --deploy",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-11T10:30:45",
    "execution_time": "145.2s",
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Deployment successful...",
    "context": {
        "operation_type": "deployment",
        "cloud_provider": "aws",
        "service": "sagemaker"
    }
}
```

2. **If Errors Occur**:
The assistant will create a GitHub issue with details:
```markdown
## Error Details
Failed to deploy model to SageMaker

### Command
`magemaker --deploy`

### Error Message
InvalidParameterError: Instance type ml.m5.xlarge not available in region us-west-2

### Context
- AWS Region: us-west-2
- Model: huggingface/bert-base-uncased
- Instance Type: ml.m5.xlarge

### Suggested Solutions
1. Verify instance type availability in the region
2. Try alternative instance types: ml.m4.xlarge, ml.c5.xlarge
3. Check AWS account limits
```

3. **Generate Tutorial**:
After successful deployment, generates a markdown tutorial:
```markdown
# Deploying HuggingFace Models to AWS SageMaker

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- magemaker-cli installed
- Active AWS account with SageMaker access

## Steps
1. Initialize project
2. Configure deployment settings
